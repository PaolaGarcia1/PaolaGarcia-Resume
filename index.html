        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a freshman at University of California Riverside. Iâ€™m currently declared but Iâ€™m working towards a bachelor's degree in Spanish. My ultimate goal is to be a teacher. More specifically a High School Spanish Teacher.  Iâ€™ve always loved kids and teaching. For me, Spanish comes very easily and I know that I would enjoy teaching it to other kids. Iâ€™ve had very impactful teachers in my life who I still talk to today. I aspire to be one of those teachers to my future students. Teaching has always been one of my passions since I was a little girl. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed the presence of kids and I want to be a positive role model in their life. I want my future students to trust and like me. Iâ€™m going to be working hard these next 3-4 years to be one of the best teachers my students ever have. I want to be there for my students when they are in need of someone. My classroom is going to be a safe space for everyone, just for students. Staff and faculty are also welcomed in my classroom. I will work hard everyday for myself but most importantly for my future students. Just walking into a classroom that I decorated and that I get to experience thousands of memories with my students, will give me all the happiness and joy in the world. I will achieve my dream of being a teacher, but most importantly a teacher that students trust and have a safe space with. 
<br><br>

        Iâ€™ve worked at elementary schools before and I loved every minute of it. I used to work at an after school program called Think Together. My class was third, fourth, and fifth graders. We had strict rules and times to follow but despite all the growing from my students they respected me and I respected them. Working with those kids for an entire year was the highlight of my life so far. My students are and were the reason why Iâ€™m so passionate about teaching. Many students just want love and to be cared for, so my goal is to be that support system for them. Many of my students came from low income families and poor neighborhoods, so they need all the love they can get. And when I was their teacher, they were loved by me. I canâ€™t wait to be giving that love to my future students again.<br><br>

        Iâ€™m currently undeclared but Iâ€™m in the process of declaring spanish. But when I declare my major to spanish, itâ€™ll be a straight shot to being a high school spanish teacher. My first language was Spanish, therefore I can read, write, and understand it fluently. Already knowing Spanish opened so many doors for my future and my future career. Spanish is a difficult language to learn, but since I grew up with that language, Itâ€™s extremely easy for me. I canâ€™t wait to teach and show students how to learn such an important language. Learning two languages will give my students more opportunities and chances in the real world.
